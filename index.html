  <h2>All the worlds a stage</h2>
  <p>All the world's a stage, <br />And all the men and women merely players;<br />They have their exits and their entrances,<br />And one man in his time plays many parts,<br />His acts being seven ages</p>

 <h2>Shall I compare thee to a summer's day? (Sonnet 18)</h2>
  <p>Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?<br /> Thou art more lovely and more temperate<br />Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,<br />And summer's lease hath all too short a date.<br /></p>
  <p>Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,<br />And often is his gold complexion dimmed;<br /> And every fair from fair sometimes declines,</p>
  <p>By chance, or by nature's changing course, untrimmed; <br /> But thy eternal summer shall not fade,<br />Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st,<br />Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,</p>
  <p>When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.<br />So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,<br />So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.</p>
 <!-- <p>This took forever...</p> -->
